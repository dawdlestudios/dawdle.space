    <p>
      <b><i>/ooc</i></b> it's a throwback to a more casual and creative
      internet: just some static html, a bit of css, images and more fun. a
      place for just dawdling around and to be creative on. if you want to join
      us just figure out a way to reach out, shouldn't be too hard :)<br />
